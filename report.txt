REPORT: Advanced Time Series Forecasting using Attention-based Deep Learning

1. Introduction
Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in energy management systems. Accurate prediction of power consumption helps in efficient resource planning and demand forecasting. Traditional statistical models such as ARIMA/SARIMA perform well for linear patterns but struggle with complex temporal dependencies.
This project implements an advanced time series forecasting system using Baseline SARIMA and a Deep Learning Attention-based LSTM model to improve prediction accuracy.

2. Dataset Description
Dataset Name: Household Power Consumption (sampled)
Source: Energy consumption time series data
Features Used:
datetime
global_active_power
voltage
sub_metering_1
Target Variable: global_active_power
Time Interval: Minute-level readings

3. Data Preprocessing (Step 1)
The preprocessing stage prepares raw data for modeling:
Combined date and time into a single datetime column
Converted datetime to pandas datetime format
Selected relevant features
Applied MinMax scaling
Created sliding window sequences for supervised learning
Reshaped data to 3D format for LSTM input
Output Shape:
X shape: (samples, time_steps, features)
y shape: (samples,)

4. Baseline Model – SARIMA (Step 2)
To establish a baseline, a Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model was implemented.
Why SARIMA?
Handles seasonality
Common benchmark for time series forecasting
Model Configuration:
SARIMAX with optimized parameters
Forecasted future values
Compared actual vs predicted values visually
Observation:
SARIMA captures overall trend
Fails to adapt to non-linear variations

5. Proposed Model – Attention-based LSTM (Step 3)
To overcome limitations of SARIMA, a Deep Learning model with Attention mechanism was developed.
Architecture:
Input Layer
LSTM Layer (50 units, return sequences)
Attention Mechanism
Context-aware LSTM
Dense Output Layer
Why Attention?
Focuses on important time steps
Improves long-term dependency learning
Enhances prediction accuracy
Framework Used:
TensorFlow / Keras (Functional API)

6. Model Training & Evaluation (Step 4)
The Attention LSTM model was trained and evaluated using standard regression metrics.
Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Optimizer: Adam
Evaluation Metrics:
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
Visualization:
Actual vs Predicted power consumption plotted
Attention-based model shows closer alignment with actual values

7. Results & Comparison
Model
Performance
SARIMA
Captures trend but less accurate

Conclusion:
The Attention-based LSTM model outperforms the traditional SARIMA baseline, especially in handling non-linear temporal patterns.

8. Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates an advanced time series forecasting system combining statistical and deep learning approaches. The Attention-based LSTM model significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to the baseline SARIMA model.
Such models are highly suitable for real-world energy forecasting applications.
